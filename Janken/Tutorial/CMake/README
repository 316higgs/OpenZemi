===================
 How to use CMake?
===================

0. Prepare source files(and other source files and include files, if you need)
   ./CMake
   |
   |--- include
   |      |---- hello.h
   |
   |--- src
         |----- main.cc
1. Add CMakeLists.txt in the current directory.
   Write the following contents in it:
     cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8)
     project(Tutorial CXX)
     add_executable(main main.cc)
2. Make a new directory under CMake, and build in it:
   $ mkdir build
   $ cd build
   $ cmake ..
   $ make
