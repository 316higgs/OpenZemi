 How to run C++ codes?
=======================

0. Prepare source codes (and other source files and include files, if you need)
1. Source codes must be built and an executable file is made after that.
   This executable file(.exe) is the file that is able to run.
   In the process of build, 
     STEP1. Compilation (via Compiler)
            (high-level programming language in source files -> assembly laguage)
     STEP2. Assembly language -> machine language (via Assembler)
            Object files(.o) are created in this step.
	    Object files are created for each source files one-by-one.
     STEP3. Object files -> Executable file (via Linker)
2. You can verify STEP.1,2 by the following command:
   (In this case, let's assume that we have two source files; main.cc and function.cc)
   $ g++ -c main.cc function.cc 
   After that, you can check that two object files that correspond to each source file.
   This is compilation.
3. As the next step, you can see that an executable file is created by the following command:
   $ g++ -o main main.o function.o
   In this here, the first argument means executable file's name, and later arguments are object file's name.
   This is Linking.
   These procedures are called Build or Make.
4. In the above method, we have two commands, but you can unify them:
   $ g++ -o main main.cc
   After that, you will obtain the same executable file main as the above one.
   You can run this executable file by
   $ ./main
